# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

Here is my link to the website:- [time tracking dashboard website](https://time-tracking-dashboard-frontend.netlify.app/)


If you would like to practice working with JSON data, I have provided a local `data.json` file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the `.html` file.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Expected behaviour

- The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".

## Where to find everything

Inside the `/design` folder, you will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing all the information about the design that you'll need, such as color palette and fonts containing guides and dimensions, so you have no inconvinience finding stuff if you like the design.‚ò∫Ô∏è


## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! I am always looking to work on and improve my projects. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email 'hi' at [my work email](saarsaach30@gmail.com).

This project is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful.

### ***Have fun coding!*** üöÄ
