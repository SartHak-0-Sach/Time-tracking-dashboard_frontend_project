# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

Here is my link to the website:- [time tracking dashboard website](https://time-tracking-dashboard-frontend.netlify.app/)


If you would like to practice working with JSON data, I have provided a local `data.json` file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the `.html` file.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### Expected behaviour

- The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".

## Where to find everything

Inside the `/design` folder, you will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts containing guides and dimensions of the design.

## Building your project

If you want to take up a challenge and try out making this project yourself, here are the steps you should follow for the same.

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:


1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.


## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! I am always looking to work on and improve my projects. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email 'hi' at saarsaach30@gmail.com

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
